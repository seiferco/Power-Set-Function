# Power Set Generation
This project implements a recursive solution to generate the Power Set of a given set of numbers. The power set is the set of all possible subsets, including the empty set and the set itself.

## Problem Description
Given an array of unique integers, the task is to find all possible subsets (the power set) of the array. The power set of a set withn elements contains 2^n subsets.

#### Example
For the input array:
nums = [1,2,3]
The output is: [[],[1],[2].[3],[1,2],[1,3],[2,3],[1,2,3]]

## How to Run
To run the script, simply execute the following into your terminal: python PowerSet.py
